# Hello everybody, 
## I am Alexander and this is my coding portfolio.

I made my master in Biology and now I am on my way to become an Data Analyst or Business Analyst.
Here, I will share some of my projects on my way.


# [Project 1: Compound Interest calculator](https://github.com/CrazyShaddy/Compound_Interest_Calculator)
* I made a calculator that calculates the compound interest and plots the graph from start till finish
* I took the user input
* I made functions to 
  * retain the CI
  * save the x-values
  * calculate the compound interest
* I made lists for x- and y-values
* Finally, I plotted the graph with matplotlib

## Example output:
