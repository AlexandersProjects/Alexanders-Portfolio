# Hello everybody,
## I am Alexander and this is my coding portfolio.

I made my master in Biology and now I am on my way to become an Data or Business Analyst.
Who knows, maybe this journey will lead me to become an data scientist?
Here, I will share some of my python projects that I coded.
Enjoy the short summaries or have a look at the code on github.

Cheers,

*Alexander*

# [Handwritten digits recognition](https://github.com/AlexandersProjects/ml_number_recognition)
* Imported 20000 pictures
* Cleaned and reshaped the images
* Explored/ visualized the images
* Performed different prediction models:
  * Linear regression
  * Decision tree
  * Random Forest
  * Simple Neuronal Network
  * Try of convoluted Neuronal Network
* Tried different evaluation methods
  * Heatmap with errors
  * Loss over epochs
  * Accuracy

## Example output:

# [Pokemon comparison](https://github.com/AlexandersProjects/legendary_pokemon_comparison)
* Explored the data
* Controlled the data
* Compared if legendary pokemon have statistically higher attack than non-legendary pokemon.

## Hypothesis

H0: The attack of legendary pokemon is lower or equal than of non-legendary pokemon.
(M[L] </= M[NL])

H1: The attack of legendary pokemon higher than of non-legendary pokemon.
(M[L] > M[NL])

## Conclusion
Legendary (M = 116.68, SD = 30.35, n = 65) pokemon have significantly higher attacks than non-legendary (M = 75.67, SD = 30.49, n = 735) pokemon (t(798) = -10.397, p = 2.513e-05, n= 798). Hence, the H0 can be discarded.
The effect-size is d = 3.438535 and is according to Cohen (1988) a very strong effect.

# [SQL film festival database](https://github.com/AlexandersProjects/SQL_Filmfestival_Database)
* I constructed a database from scratch
* I created all necessary tables
* I made all the necessary connections and indices
* I created views, procedures and triggers
* I made useful table and scalar functions

## The created database:

# [Height and weight Dataset with OOP](https://github.com/CrazyShaddy/height_weight_analysis_and_prediction)
* I scraped data from a website
* I explored the data
* I included everything in objects (OOP)
* I retained graphs from my classes
  * Sub plots
  * Regression line
* I made my first small prediction

## Created output:

# [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/CrazyShaddy/Exploratory-Data-Analysis)
* I explored data from an online database
* I extracted different dataframes
* I merged important dataframes
* I made
  * Bar charts
  * Pie chart
  * Box plot
  * Sub plots
  * Different sub plots in one figure

## Created output:

# [Compound Interest calculator](https://github.com/CrazyShaddy/Compound_Interest_Calculator)
* I made a calculator that calculates the compound interest and plots the graph from start till finish
* I took the user input
* I made functions to
  * retain the CI
  * save the x-values
  * calculate the compound interest
* I made lists for x- and y-values
* Finally, I plotted the graph with matplotlib

## Example output:
