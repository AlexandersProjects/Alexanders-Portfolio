# Hello all, I am Alexander 

This is my coding portfolio. I just started to learn Python but I am sure that I will soon code Data Analysis.

[# Project 1: Compound Interest calculator](https://github.com/CrazyShaddy/Compound_Interest_Calculator)
* I made a calculator that calculates the compound interest and plots the graph from start till finish
* I took the user input
* I made functions to 
  * retain the CI
  * save the x-values
  * calculate the compound interest
* I made lists for x- and y-values
* Finally, I plotted the graph with matplotlib
